    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>16 ounces cremini mushrooms or white button</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup diced small onion</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic minced</li>
        <li>1/3 cup raw cashews or hemp seeds, sunflower seeds for nut free</li>
        <li>1/4 cup nutritional yeast</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh Italian parsley </li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>pinch of red chili flakes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and grease a large baking pan with olive oil.</li>
        <li>Carefully remove the stems from the mushrooms. Set the mushroom caps aside and finely chop the stems.</li>
        <li>In a medium-sized pan, warm the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onions and chopped mushroom stems and saut√© for about 5 minutes, until tender. Add the garlic and cook for 1 more minute. Remove mixture from heat.</li>
        <li>In a food processor or high powered blender, add the cashews, nutritional yeast, garlic powder, parsley, thyme and salt. Pulse until a crumbly consistency is reached. Do not pulse for too long or it will turn into a paste.</li>
        <li>In a medium-sized bowl, add the cashew mixture, along with the panko breadcrumbs, red chili flakes and cooked onions/mushroom stems/garlic. Stir everything together to combine.</li>
        <li>Spoon the filling into the mushroom caps and place on the prepared baking pan. Spray the stuffed mushrooms with olive oil (or drizzle a little on each one). </li>
        <li>Bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes, until the tops are golden. Serve immediately and enjoy.</li>
